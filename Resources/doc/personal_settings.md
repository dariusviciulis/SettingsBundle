# Personal settings


## Introduction
> This functionality will require You to login using [Sessionless authentication](ongr_sessionless_authentication.md).

While using this functionality, settings can be changed per user, from the settings page and the selected values are stored in a separate cookie.


## Usage

Add some settings that are grouped in categories into your `config.yml`:

```yaml
parameters:
    profiles: [ default, test1, test2, foo_profile ]

    ongr_settings.settings.categories:
        category_1:
            name: Category 1
            description: cat_desc_1
        category_2:
            name: Category 2

    ongr_settings.settings.settings:
        foo_setting_1:
            name: Foo Setting 1
            category: category_1
            description: 'foo_desc_1'
        foo_setting_2:
            name: Foo Setting 2
            category: category_1
        foo_setting_3:
            name: Foo Setting 3
            category: category_2
            description: 'foo_desc_3'
            cookie: project.cookie.alternative_settings # Setting stored in a separate cookie (this cookie must be configured as service)
```

Settings must have a `name` and `category`. `description` is optional but highly recommended.

Categories must have a `name`. `description` is optional.

Settings menu is visible under `/settings_prefix/settings`. The user must be logged in to see the page.

Settings can be stored in multiple cookie stating `cookie` parameter and providing cookie service.
More info on usage can be found in [How to work with cookies documentation](https://github.com/ongr-io/CookiesBundle).

Using Settings UI (Personal settings) you can toggle between their output values in twig.


### TWIG

User selected values can be queried easily from TWIG like this:

```twig
{% if ongr_setting_enabled('foo_setting_2') %}
    Text when user is logged in and setting equals to true.
{% else %}
    Otherwise.
{% endif %}
```

Also it's possible to access these values without logging in by setting second parameter to `false`:

```twig
{% if ongr_setting_enabled('foo_setting_2', false) %}
```

Or using a `UserSettingsManager` service:

```php
$this->userSettingsManager = $container->get('ongr_settings.settings.user_settings_manager');
$isEnabled = $this->userSettingsManager->getSettingEnabled($settingName);
```


### Settings change API

Settings visibility can be toggled when the user visits specific URL generated for that setting. E.g.:

- [http://example.com/settings_prefix/settings/change/Nqlx9N1QthIaQ9wJz0GNY79LoYeZUbJC6OuNe==](http://example.com/settings_prefix/settings/change/Nqlx9N1QthIaQ9wJz0GNY79LoYeZUbJC6OuNe==)

So it is possible to send such URL to remote user enabling him to toggle between setting values. `ongr_setting_enabled` second parameter must be set to false. E.g.: `ongr_setting_enabled('foo_setting_2', false)`.

To enable this functionality you should add an entry to your firewall to enable anonymous access to one of the controllers:

```yaml
access_control:
    - { path: ^/settings_prefix/setting/change/.*, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
```
